# üß™ O-QT: The OECD QSAR Toolbox AI Assistant

O-QT is a multi-agent AI system that connects to your local OECD QSAR Toolbox installation. It automates the process of chemical analysis, hazard assessment, and read-across strategy development, producing comprehensive, auditable reports.

The application uses a team of specialized LangChain and OpenAI-powered agents to interpret data fetched from the OECD QSAR Toolbox WebAPI, providing a seamless workflow from chemical search to final report.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirement: The OECD QSAR Toolbox API

This assistant application CANNOT function without the official OECD QSAR Toolbox software running on a Windows machine.

* What it is: The OECD QSAR Toolbox is a separate, comprehensive software package developed by the OECD. It contains the necessary databases, calculation engines, and profiling tools that O-QT relies on.
* How this app uses it: O-QT acts as a client. It connects to the Web API of your locally running QSAR Toolbox instance to request data (like properties, experimental results, and profiling). The AI agents then process and interpret the data received from the Toolbox API.
* Where to get it: You must download and install it directly from the OECD: OECD QSAR Toolbox Download Page: https://qsartoolbox.org/downloads/
* Operating System: The OECD QSAR Toolbox software runs only on Microsoft Windows.
* License: You must agree to the OECD QSAR Toolbox End User License Agreement (EULA) when you install it.

#### Why can't the Toolbox be included in a Docker image?

The QSAR Toolbox EULA strictly prohibits redistribution, copying, or modification of the software. This means:
* No Bundling: We cannot legally include the QSAR Toolbox software within this application's code.
* No Docker Image: We cannot create or distribute a Docker image containing the QSAR Toolbox software, as this would be unauthorized redistribution.

Therefore, manual installation and API activation by each user on a Windows machine is the only compliant way to use this assistant.

### Features

* Chemical search by name or SMILES notation.
* Retrieval of physicochemical properties, experimental data, and chemical profiling information.
* Downloadable raw data (JSON, CSV) and synthesized AI reports (PDF, TXT).
* Advanced AI Analysis: A team of specialized AI agents analyzes the data:
    * Chemical Context: Confirms the chemical's identity.
    * Physical Properties: Analyzes physical characteristics.
    * Environmental Fate: Evaluates environmental behavior.
    * Profiling/Reactivity: Assesses reactivity and toxicological alerts.
    * Experimental Data: Interprets measured experimental results.
    * Metabolism: Analyzes predicted metabolites from simulators.
    * QSAR Predictions: Interprets in-domain QSAR model results.
    * Read-Across: Identifies data gaps and suggests analogue strategies.
    * Synthesis: Combines all analyses into a final, coherent report.

### Installation and Usage Guide

#### Method 1: Docker (Recommended)

This is the easiest and most reliable way to run the O-QT Assistant. It isolates the application's dependencies but still requires a connection to your separate QSAR Toolbox installation.

Step 1: Prerequisites
* Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
* Complete the setup for the OECD QSAR Toolbox on a Windows machine, ensuring its WebAPI is enabled and running. Note the IP address of this machine.

Step 2: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/oqt-assistant.git
cd oqt-assistant
```

Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file by copying the provided example.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and fill in your details:

```env
# URL of your running QSAR Toolbox API.
# Replace <IP_ADDRESS_OF_WINDOWS_PC> with the actual IP address.
QSAR_TOOLBOX_API_URL="http://<IP_ADDRESS_OF_WINDOWS_PC>:5001/api/v6.0"

# Provide ONE of the following API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."

# Optional: Set to "1" to redact the API URL in generated PDFs
# OQT_REDACT_PDF_URLS=1
```

> Networking Tip: If you are running Docker on the same Windows machine as the Toolbox, you may need to use `host.docker.internal` instead of an IP address. For example: `QSAR_TOOLBOX_API_URL="http://host.docker.internal:5001/api/v6.0"`

Step 4: Build and Run the Docker Container

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t oqt-assistant .

# Run the container, passing the .env file for configuration
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env oqt-assistant
```

Step 5: Access the Assistant
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501. Check the sidebar to confirm a successful connection to your QSAR Toolbox.

#### Method 2: Local Python (For Development)

This method is for contributors or users who want to run the application directly from the source code.

Step 1: Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+ and `pip` installed.
* Complete the setup for the OECD QSAR Toolbox on a Windows machine, as described above.

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Step 3: Install Dependencies
From the root of the cloned repository, install the project in editable mode with development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Create and edit the `.env` file as described in Step 3 of the Docker instructions, ensuring `QSAR_TOOLBOX_API_URL` points to your running Toolbox instance.

Step 5: Run the Application
Launch the Streamlit app using the installed command-line script:

```bash
oqt-assistant
```

Then, access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

### How to Use the Assistant

1. Check Connection: Use the "Check Connection" button in the sidebar to ensure O-QT can communicate with your QSAR Toolbox API.
2. Enter Input: In the main area, select a search type (Name or SMILES), enter the chemical identifier, and provide any analysis context.
3. Configure Scope: Select the desired metabolism simulators, profilers, and QSAR models you wish to run.
4. Analyze: Click the "üöÄ Analyze Chemical" button to start the workflow. A progress bar will show the current status.
5. Review Results: Explore the generated data in the tabs for properties, experimental data, profiling, etc.
6. Download: Use the download buttons in the sidebar to save the comprehensive PDF report, the full JSON log, or individual agent analyses as TXT files.
